# LeetCode Solutions

This is a repository for solutions to problems found on LeetCode
(<https://leetcode.com>), written in Python3.

Solution files are enumerated to match the problem number. Each file is a
self-contained solution, meaning it can be run from the command line, will
take user input, and display the solution.

The goal here is to keep track of solutions while writing pretty, documented,
readable code. Readability is emphasized over conciseness, and the solution
approach should be explained well.

If a problem has multiple solutions (and I found/understood/implemented them
all), the user will be asked to choose their desired solving method. This was
done more as an excersice for myself, since the user should see the same result
regardless of the method of solving.
